                    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a
                        group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
                        defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For
                        instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. </p>
